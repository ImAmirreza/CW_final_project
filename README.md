**Maze Solver Project**

This project provides a set of algorithms to solve mazes. The project includes a MazeGame class that generates a random maze and provides methods to find the player and exit positions, as well as to check if a move is valid. The project also includes three solver classes: BFS_Solver, DFS_Solver, and AStar_Solver, which implement the Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, and A\* algorithms, respectively.

**Features**

* Generates a random maze with a player and exit position
* Provides methods to find the player and exit positions
* Checks if a move is valid
* Implements three solver algorithms: BFS, DFS, and A\*
* Prints the maze and solution path
* Provides statistics on the solution, including path length and time taken

**Usage**

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ImAmirreza/CW_final_project.git`
2. Run the project: `python main.py`
